Implementation of a Medical Laboratory Application
The application enables the management of patient data, administration, medical tests, and results. By utilizing the C# programming language and the .NET Framework, along with an SQL database, we have created a functional system with a clear and intuitive user interface.

The application allows laboratory staff to easily enter, update, and delete data on patients, medical tests, and results, thereby improving the efficiency of the medical laboratory. Special attention has been given to data security and accuracy, ensuring the integrity of information.

Considering the needs of the medical laboratory, the implemented functionalities provide a comprehensive approach to data management, facilitating the daily tasks of laboratory personnel.

Through this application, harmony between modern technologies and the specific requirements of the medical environment has been achieved.
